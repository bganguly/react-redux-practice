This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Contains a colelction of small code snippets- which i was practicing by writing out first (pena nd paper)  
and then coding to catch basic syntax mistakes.  
This branch builds a one line component and practices passing hardcoded props  
from index.js to App.js to the component.
