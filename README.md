This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Contains a colelction of small code snippets- which i was practicing by writing out first (pena nd paper)  
and then coding to catch basic syntax mistakes.  
This branch builds  
- a one line component that accepts  props - called as 'child' component
- a different component that wraps the above - called as 'parent' component
- shows how to useState in parent to set the value of the prop being passed to child
