This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Contains a colelction of small code snippets- which i was practicing by writing out first (pena nd paper)  
and then coding to catch basic syntax mistakes.  
This branch builds  
- a one line component that accepts user input - called as 'sibling 1' component
- a different fetch component that calls a github api when user input in sibling 1 is not empty
- a third component that shows the data from the fetch operation above
- shows how to declare the 'sibling 1' with an eventhandler name as prop (object destructured)  
 and invocation in parent for the fetch component sets its prop using defined usestate.  
 Finally the third component is invoked from the wrapper using data received from  
 the fetch operation
