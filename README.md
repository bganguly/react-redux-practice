This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Contains a colelction of small code snippets- which i was practicing by writing out first (pena nd paper)  
and then coding to catch basic syntax mistakes.  
This branch builds  
- a one line component that accepts user input - called as 'sibling 1' component
- another one liner component that shows state variables - called as 'sibling 2' component
- a third component that wraps the above two - called as 'parent' component
- shows how to declare the 'sibling 1' with an eventhandler name as prop (object destructured)  
 and invocation in parent for this child sets its prop using uses arrow function  
 and useState in parent sets the value of the required prop update for 'sibling 2'
