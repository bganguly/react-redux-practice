This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Contains a colelction of small code snippets- which i was practicing by writing out first (pena nd paper)  
and then coding to catch basic syntax mistakes.  
This branch builds  
- a one line component that accepts user input - called as 'child' component
- a different component that wraps the above - called as 'parent' component
- shows how to declare the child with an eventhandler name as prop (object destructured)  
 and invocation in parent for the child sets uses arrow function and useState in parent  
 to set the value of the required dom update in parent
