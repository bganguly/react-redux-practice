This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Contains a colelction of small code snippets- which i was practicing by writing out first (pena nd paper)  
and then coding to catch basic syntax mistakes.  
This branch builds  
- a one line component that accepts user input - called as 'sibling 1' component
- a different fetch component that is called when user input in sibling 1 is not empty  and which in turn invokes a custom hook that encapsulates the call to github api
- a third component that shows the data from the fetch operation above
- shows how to use custom hooks
